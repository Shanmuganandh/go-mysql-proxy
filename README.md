# go-mysql-proxy

Work in progress

Motivations:
* While working on python based web applications, we end up tuning the
	processes and treads model based on the infrastructure and performance
	requirements. If we have any connection caching strategy in place, the
	tuning become complex since we are dealing with process/threads + connection
	cache. Having a connection pool proxy helps with managing the connection
	cache strategy independent of the process/threads model.
* Connection caching at the application level would be local to a Python VM
	process and a connection established in a process can not be shared with
	other processes.
